        <strong>The History of Kiteboarding &amp; Launch of a New Sport</strong><br>
            I’m sure we can all agree that kiteboarding has to be one of the most dynamic and exhilarating sports on the planet. In fact, even people who have never had the pleasure of kiteboarding themselves, are drawn to the sport and fascinated by the speed, insanely high jumps, dizzying combinations of tricks, or the purity of riding the waves like surfers. But have you ever wondered where kiteboarding came from, who invented the inflatable kite, or how we got to where we are today as kiteboarders?          
    </p>
    <p>  
      There are of course a number of great resources documenting the history of kiteboarding or kitesurfing, but we thought we’d summarise the highlights for you, so you can get back to doing what you live for… kiteboarding. And if you’d rather get body slammed into a mine field of sea urchins on an exposed reef than read an article on the history of kiteboarding, then feel free to skip straight to the video below, which is a humorous and very entertaining look at how it all started.

      Seriously though, we can’t thank the producers, Josh Kendrick and Dan Connely enough for this brilliant tribute to kiteboarding, which comes packed with interviews with all the great pioneers of kitesurfing, and is what inspired us to write this article in the first place. It’s 55min long, so if you don’t have time for that, we’ve also included a 6 min video, Short Kiteboarding History by Susi Mai and Robby Naish.
